                        <h6>Overview</h6>
                        <p>The use of media as a tool for social change needs a careful approach in terms of ethics as
                            well
                            as taking a respectful manner working with a certain subject. One of the examples is working
                            with a marginalized subject that might be living in an oppressed situation or living with
                            trauma. Telling this kind of story can be very challenging.
                        </p>

                        <p>The main purpose of this project is to give a voice to the voiceless, to empower them with an
                            effective storytelling. I have realized that there is no safe way of capturing and telling a
                            story of a survivor who wishes to remain anonymous; most of them who want to speak in public
                            or
                            in front of camera want to hide their real identities, either for their own safety or for
                            the
                            safety of those surrounding them. Therefore, anonymity is important in this stage, and
                            finding a
                            medium of storytelling that can enhance this issue is not simple.</p>

                        <p>At some point, people who experience an oppressed situation do not know how to speak up about
                            the problem, not only because they are afraid of their vulnerable position, but also because
                            they are afraid of the stigma that will follows as they become a survivor.
                            When one survivor shares their story, it inspires other survivors to speak out about the
                            same
                            issue. This can be evidenced when people began speaking out about their personal experiences
                            during the #MeToo movement.
                        </p>
                        <p>The question of using media as an appropriate tool to solve this problem remains in my
                            head. Searching for an applicable and effective way of telling that kind of sensitive
                            story is very essential, and to make it happen it needs a careful design which involves
                            a multi-disciplinary collaboration. This project uses online interactive platform that
                            connects survivor and animation artists so then they can produce a short animated
                            documentary
                            about a sensitive/unspoken story. There are two mediums that are
                            incorporated in the development of this platform, which are animation and interactive
                            media.

                        <p>Having long-term experience in using video as a tool to capture human stories and
                            using
                            them as a tool to express a true voice through non-fiction storytelling and
                            documentary
                            filmmaking seems not enough to solve that problem. Even though traditional video and
                            filmmaking tools is getting better on capturing and processing more realistic
                            images,
                            when it comes to a story of a very sensitive subject there is always a kind of
                            barrier
                            that appears during the process. Protecting the identity of this kind of subject is
                            another huge challenge.
                        </p>



                        <p>More inclusive way of media production with a vulnerable subject.
                        </p>

                        <p>At the end of 2019, there was an interesting case that involved some undocumented
                            media
                            makers who requested an apology from the producers of a Netflix series entitled
                            “Living
                            Undocumented”(Collective, 2019). The series tells stories of what it means to be an
                            undocumented immigrant in the United States today. During the pre-production
                            process,
                            the producer of the series reached out to different immigrant rights organizations
                            and
                            undocumented activists, with the hopes to find individuals that might be interested
                            in
                            being featured on the series. The problem came up after one of the undocumented
                            media
                            makers thought that it was a good opportunity for them to get involved on the
                            production
                            process directly, not just as an outsider subject but also included on the
                            production
                            process. However, without any further consideration regarding the collaborative
                            idea,
                            the producers said that it wasn’t even an option to work with those undocumented
                            media
                            makers for the series.
                        </p>

                        <p>According to the letter, the collective stressed that the outsider perspective of
                            making
                            their stories by not asking them to collaborate on the production has been
                            perpetuated
                            for a number of different projects. The exclusion problem is raised up because of
                            their
                            status as undocumented media makers. This exclusion has been happening for a long
                            time,
                            and it seems there is no clear path to resolve the problem. Therefore, an
                            appropriate
                            platform that is inclusive and more participative should be developed –  not only in
                            support of these two aspects of inclusivity but also as a way to create a more
                            empowering platform for the subject. The subject is able to find a better way to
                            tell
                            their stories in a secure way and independently, without relying to other people or
                            even
                            big production companies to feature their stories.

                        <h6>Solution</h6>

                        <p>There are obvious problems such as inclusivity, the production of sensitive stories
                            and
                            animosity on the use of media for storytelling. Therefore, how this media can create
                            a
                            change needs to be explained. Animation will be used to cover the survivor’s
                            identity by
                            replacing it with different characters and representations, and interactive media
                            will
                            be utilized to enhance the participatory process of this media. </p>

                        <p>Animation is an effective tool for social change as it can convey complex ideas in a
                            short time, can appeal to various age groups, and can address sensitive issues in an
                            open and unthreatening way (Carnegie,1996). The platform will be developed either as
                            an
                            app or website. My main role for this project is to become the moderator or
                            facilitator.
                            The survivor and the animator will work together as collaborators. This idea was
                            initiated as the adaptive result of the current development of digital technology
                            and
                            the revolution industry 4.0. When people are having more access to mobile broadband
                            and
                            sophisticated gadgets such as smartphones, they can connect through the internet and
                            established interactions via social media. This is an era when people can create
                            personal content independently and publish it globally.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, I have listed
                            some points that could explain some basic purposes of this project:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Giving an appropriate way for survivors to tell their stories securely,

                                <li>Giving them access to better storytelling using the right means of
                                    communication.
                                </li>
                                <li>Creating a story that is empowering and inspiring from the community and for
                                    the
                                    community.

                                <li>Creating a story that is more collaborative and participative among
                                    different
                                    types of collaborators.
                                </li>
                                <li>Empowering/enhancing the survivor with new skills and new way of
                                    storytelling.
                                </li>
                                <li>Giving another perspective of the media producer with whom they collaborate.
                                </li>
                                <li>Giving a new opportunity for a professional media producer (animation
                                    artist)
                                    for creating a social change and making better contribution to the society.
                                </li>
                                <li>Making an outcome as a solution for other survivors to follow the project.

                        <p>Looking back to the time when I started to think about the idea of developing this
                            platform, I was trying to develop my own animation documentary. I was searching
                            throughout the internet to find an animation software that is accesible, handy and
                            easy
                            to learn by anyone on any different levels.
                            I found some free online platforms, which mostly they are for educational or
                            commercial
                            purposes. I found no narrative exploration on those existing platforms. Bouncing
                            around
                            my idea to a different people including my advisors and interactive instructors,I
                            didn't
                            find any satisfying answers. While exploring all the platforms online, I also watch
                            one
                            of the MFA cohorts Neketa Forde, whom at that time was working on her short animated
                            documentary about an assylum seeker, who flee from their home country because of
                            gender
                            persecution and residing in the U.S.
                            From her project, I kept thinking that why there is no platform that connects those
                            two
                            type of people. A person who has a story but having difficulties to tell it, and a
                            person who is seeking a story and wanted to help somebody to tell the story. So,
                            that
                            basically how I discover the idea of developing this platform. </p>

                        <p>I keep exploring the idea, with the quest of finding existing platforms outthere. One
                            of
                            my advisors suggested me to check a platform called HitRecord, it's an online
                            collaborative platform to connect people from different backgrounds, skills, and
                            education levels to create a collaborative project online.
                            This platform was founded and developed by actor Joseph-Gordon Levitt.</p>

                        <p>Along the way, I also found Fiver, a marketplace for freelance creative individuals
                            to
                            share their
                            skill and work with the clients directly. I found another good example when I was
                            reading a newspaper someday called Daivergent. This platform interestingly unlocks
                            the
                            unique aptitude of people on the autism spectrum, connecting companies to a
                            high-quality
                            workforce.</p>

                        <p>Daivergent then become one of the good examples on how developing an online
                            collaborative platform can be used to solve any social issues. This is a more
                            specific
                            example of how an interactive media platform been used to create a change, within
                            the
                            spectrum of a vulnerable community.
                            During my quest, I also found other platforms such as 1in6, a project that
                            also deals with survivor and photographer. The Bristlecone project is a project by
                            Dr.
                            David Lisak, the co-founder of 1in6, an organization whose mission is to help men
                            who
                            have had unwanted or abusive sexual encounters deal with their trauma and live
                            happier
                            and healthier.

                            Their mission also includes serving family members, friends, partners, and service
                            providers by providing information and support resources on the web and in the
                            community.

                            This project is a good example of how media, especially portrait photography and
                            documentary film, play an important role in expressing a trauma by male survivors.
                        </p>

                        <p>Recently, I also just discovered a platform
                            called StoryCorps that compiles user generated contents using direct interview audio
                            and
                            then develop it into a great
                            final piece of story, they're also using animation as part of their final product.
                            But I
                            can see that the animation were done by professional animator without any
                            collaborative
                            efforts.

                        <p>During my journey of finding inspiration and the existing platforms above, I also
                            work on
                            analyzing those examples. To analyze all those different
                            examples I created three aspects to measure the interactive and collaborative
                            components
                            of each platforms. The metrics are :
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Role Determination</strong></li>
                                <p>This aspect means that there are differentiation between two different type
                                    of
                                    user involved in the paltform. For example between storyteller and media
                                    producer,or survivor and photographer, someone with autism and the
                                    workforce,
                                    and etc. This separation is important to make the interaction simple. Just
                                    like
                                    on any other online platforms such as AirBnB who connects traveller and
                                    host,
                                    Uber who connects driver and passenger and many more examples. </p>
                                <li><strong>Participation Determination</strong></li>
                                <p>This aspect will measure how inclusive and participative is the platform,
                                    through
                                    their options of creating their profile, setting up account settings, the
                                    options
                                    that available on the platform and how it will represent the user when they
                                    finished set up their profile.</p>
                                <li><strong>Collaboration Engagement</strong></li>
                                <p>The last part of the measurement aspect is about how the two type of users
                                    can
                                    collaborate and work together to create one piece work together as the
                                    outcome
                                    of this platform. Many of the existing platform unfortunately didn't go to
                                    this
                                    direction, while in my opinion this is actually the back bone of the
                                    platform
                                    that I'm currently developing.</p>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>The undocumented migrant worker as the survivor.</strong></p>

                        <p>For the first series as part of this thesis, I will feature the stories of undocumented
                            migrant
                            worker communities from Indonesia. I will be focusing on a specific type of Indonesian
                            migrant
                            worker who worked at cruise ships around the sea coast of the U.S. The Indonesian migrant
                            cruise
                            ship workers are not deployed in the deluxe part of the ship, such as on the entertainment
                            side,
                            dining-bar or even on the ship operational crew (captain, the staff captain, and seamen).
                            The
                            Indonesian migrant workers are mostly engaged in the hotel sector, responsible for the
                            cleaning
                            section, or as the hotel room boy, taking care of the food and beverage behind the kitchen
                            door,
                            or responsible for the galley or laundry place. According to an interview by Manola Abella
                            in
                            Labor education provided by ILO in 2002, migrant workers are among the most vulnerable
                            people in
                            society. They often come to destination countries where they are doing the jobs which local
                            residents no longer want to do. They are regularly subjected to abusive, exploitative and
                            discriminatory treatment, there is a term called “Three-Ds” jobs which denotes dirty,
                            degrading
                            and dangerous (Abella, 2002).</p>

                        <p>These migrant workers are at high risk of facing exploitation by their employer in the
                            workplace. It relatively involves long hours of work but low wages. According to the stated
                            report, these migrant workers are in the bottom level of all the crew ship workers. This
                            unfair
                            labor condition and discriminatory treatment force the Indonesian migrant workers to leave
                            their
                            contract and become undocumented migrant workers through illegal status conversion (Han,
                            2002).
                            An Indonesian-American community magazine based in San Francisco known as Kabari reported in
                            2008 that 3 out of 10 Indonesian migrant workers on cruise ships violated their visa status
                            and
                            ran away from the cruise ship to find a job in the mainland of the U.S. This phenomenon is
                            known
                            to the Indonesian migrant workers’ communities as “jump-ship” (Digital kabari#16 jun08,
                            n.d.).
                        </p>

                        <p>According to several sources of research that discuss about the current migration movement,
                            there is a deep connection between the closer connectivity through easier broadband access
                            to
                            the internet with the increase number of migration populations (Dekker & Engbersen, 2014;
                            Komito, 2011; Lee, 2012; Rianne Dekker et al., 2018). With additional aspects such as the
                            network established through the advanced development of smartphone and social media apps,
                            people
                            can more easily get information regarding migration patterns and destination countries.</p>

                        <p>I started my interaction with the “exodus” Indonesian migrant worker in the U.S as just a
                            pure
                            connection because I am of the same nationality. I equipped myself with my previous
                            experience
                            in documentary filmmaking and started to hear their stories, took small observations of
                            their
                            activity that probably will be useful for my story bank in the future. During this
                            observation,
                            I found some sort of pattern that is looping throughout the migration cycle, and it involves
                            the
                            use of media and technology. On this specific case, at the modern era of networking
                            technology
                            and expansive broadband, these undocumented migrant workers have fully utilized social media
                            as
                            their way of entering the U.S unauthorized and have enhanced a probably “undetected”
                            irregular
                            migration pattern. Maintain their living in the U.S mainland for quite a while, sending
                            remittances back home, assimilates with local by few numbers of marriage, growing up their
                            business and becoming a big diaspora community in the U.S.

                        <p>The undocumented migrant worker’s communities that will be featured on this first series are
                            located in Marietta, Ohio and Parkersburg, West Virginia.

                        <p>For the animator side, I'm inviting the OU Animation Club members to test out the prototype
                            platform. I was once joining their weekly meeting during my first semester in OU.
                            This club consists of a group of passionate animation students from the School of Media Arts
                            &
                            Studies.</p>
                        <p>During this prospective user scouting, I also reach out to the animation Professor, Kate
                            Raney,
                            who at my
                            second semester
                            helped me a lot on developing a non-digital animation project as part of my independent
                            study
                            "finding an accesibale animation techniques". Turns out on the Spring Semester 2021, Prof.
                            Raney
                            is conducting a new class called "Animated Documentary".
                            So throughout that class, I proposed the idea and work-in-progress prototype of my thesis.
                            The
                            details participation of their role on the development of this thesis can be seen on the
                            "user
                            test" section. Below is an example of the animation short film from the OU Animation club:

                            While sketching the site map, I keep questioning what's this platform beneficial for
                            the
                            survivor side? What's this platform valuable for the animator side?
                            Through this site map, I am also imagining on how all the options of each users when
                            they start to utilize the platform. Below are the detailed site map on the user on
                            boarding and two distinction on the user profile creation. Click on each image to see the
                            details. </p>

                        <h6>Logo</h6>

                        <p>In the beginning, I was only going to create a logo for the platform. I did many
                            iterarions by sketching font logo and pictorial logo on my sketch book.
                            While working on the logo, I was also trying to find the right typography.
                            During
                            the process I found out that the first draft of the logo looked very formal.
                            The slogan of "secure story" doesn't feel fit to the goals of this platform. I'm
                            takin an alternative way, by developing something that relates from what I
                            learned
                            from the animation side.
                            Which is start by developing a character. I've been thinking that hopefully this
                            character could be a good "neutral" representation of the platform users. I will
                            ellaborate more about the character development on more sections below. </p>

                        <p>Above are some sketches on how I iterate the logo and character design. I wanted
                            to
                            create a visual identity that is very simple, started to sketching some multiple
                            lines to shape the logo and the character.
                            One interesting starting point when I developed the character was when I wanted
                            to
                            represent the expression of the users after they use this platform. One of the
                            purposes of this platform's development is to give a comforting space to those
                            who
                            are in a fragile position and not able to tell their stories, so I want to
                            represent
                            the expression after the user utilized this platform, which is a relieved
                            expression.

                    <div class="col-lg-8 margin-top">
                        <p>So, as you can see on the picture above. I finally develop the logo and character
                            based on the relieved-face. There three combinations of the logo and the
                            character,
                            first is the font logo - all capitals using humanist typeface called "Gill
                            Sans".
                            The second is the face of the character that represent the relieved face. Then
                            on
                            the third components is the three curve components which is transformable to
                            create
                            a "wave" that also represent digital connection and collaboration.
                            Below is the specific setting on how to use the logo on different medium.

                        <h6>Character and Animation Projection</h6>
                        <p>I named this character "Survy", the face represent a feeling of relieved. I
                            created
                            four different actions of the character, which then I put these characters in
                            the
                            introduction of this platform.
                            Those for actions represent the comforting feeling that I want to achieve
                            through
                            this platform. Like sitting and listening on each stories, interacting using
                            digital
                            devices, and one action that represent movement.

                            its
                            smile. Please take a look at the simpe animated example below:</p>

                        <h6>Color Pallete</h6>
                        <p>I innitiated to use two primary colors which are red and yellow, with the idea of
                            those two colors can represent urgency and attention. On the rough sketch of the
                            visual identity above, you can see the original red and yellow colors.
                            Then I twist a little bit of the color into red magenta and dark yellow, so then
                            the
                            app is looks more informal. I added two other secondary colors which are light
                            blue
                            and green for the accents and buttons of the platform.

                            independently able to tell the stories.
                            The red magenta means universal love, it also promotes attention, compassion,
                            and
                            cooperation. With the hope it can represent another main concept of this

                            For the body text, I picked "Epilogue", because this typeface looks modern,
                            handy,
                            but can give a good contrast with the heading typeface.

                        <p>After finishing the design materials and the style guide, I incorporated
                            all
                            materials together into an interactive prototype using a prototype
                            software
                            called "Figma".
                            Figma has been very useful on providing an interactive and shareable
                            platform to build the prototype. I praised for all the features from
                            this
                            software.
                            Including the framing windows for mobile-applicaction, the ability to
                            edit
                            .svg file, shaping buttons and accents for the app, untill their feature
                            in
                            providing some useful
                            icons to shape the prototype looks more professional.
                            With the additional combination such as the character design, pick of
                            colors
                            and choose of typeface. This process of developing the app has been the
                            most
                            exciting part of this project.

                        <p><strong>User Test</strong></p>

                        <p>One of the features of using Figma as the prototyping software is that
                            this
                            software has a very efficient connection to the user test platform
                            called
                            "Maze".
                            I can automatically connect the prototype that I'm developing from
                            "Figma"
                            to the user test platform "Maze".
                            Maze will record all the user/research participant’s decisions
                            (“clicks”)
                            when they navigate the prototype. The recorded interaction (user test
                            result) then will be used to determine the development of the real
                            application.</p>

                        <p>The projected users/research participants will interact with the
                            prototype
                            through Maze. They will navigate throughout all the paths and options in
                            the
                            prototype. The choices participants make will be accessible by me via
                            Maze,
                            but no personal information will be collected. At the end of the user
                            test,
                            there will be questions that ask about the effectiveness of the
                            prototype.
                            These questions , such as:
                            <ol>
                                <li>How clear is the path?</li>
                                <li>Rate the overall user
                                    test experience?</li>
                                <li>Should anything be removed or added in the current
                                    prototype?</li>

                            </ol> These questions will help me in the iterative design process to
                            improve my
                            prototype.</p>


                        <p>Currently, within Maze, I have created two different categories of user
                            tests. These categories were created by looking back to my competitve
                            analysis of the exsisting platform. They are the “Role Determination”
                            and
                            “Participation
                            Determination”, on this stage, I haven't reached to the part of making
                            the
                            "Collaborative Connection". On each category it has its own path,
                            allowing
                            users the opportunity to
                            choose different options. Through their process of interacting with the
                            paths, their choices will be recorded. The recorded interaction will be
                            analyzed as part of the development of the design process. Click to two
                            buttons below to do the usr test
